# Implementation Tasks for Image to ASCII Generator

## Overview
This task list is organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Each user story phase includes all tasks needed to complete that story independently.

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)
- T001: Set up project structure with src/image_to_ascii/ package and __init__.py [X]
- T002: Create pyproject.toml with dependencies (Pillow, numpy) and entry points [X]
- T003: Install dependencies using pip [X]

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
- T004: Implement image_processing.py module for loading and resizing images [X]
- T005: Implement symbol_selection.py module for character selection using statistical moments [X]
- T006: Implement ascii_conversion.py module for generating ASCII art [X]
- T007: Implement output.py module for saving ASCII to file [X]

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Image Conversion (P1)
**Goal**: Enable users to convert a standard image into ASCII art.

**Independent Test**: Upload a sample image and verify ASCII art is generated and displayed.

**Tasks**:
- T008: Update main.py CLI to accept --input and --output arguments [P] [X]
- T009: Integrate image_processing, ascii_conversion, output modules in main.py [P] [X]
- T010: Test basic conversion with sample image [X]

**Parallel Execution Example**:
```
T008 & T009 & T010
```

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete and independently testable.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Customizable Output Dimensions (P2)
**Goal**: Allow users to adjust the size of the ASCII art.

**Independent Test**: Set custom width and verify output respects dimensions.

**Tasks**:
- T011: Update CLI to accept --width argument [X]
- T012: Update resize_image function to use specified width [X]
- T013: Test custom dimensions with different widths [X]

**Parallel Execution Example**:
```
T011 & T012 & T013
```

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 complete and independently testable.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Save and Share Output (P3)
**Goal**: Enable users to save the generated ASCII art to a file.

**Independent Test**: Generate ASCII art and verify file contains correct text.

**Tasks**:
- T014: Enhance output.py to handle file saving with error handling [X]
- T015: Update CLI to require --output argument [X]
- T016: Test file saving with various outputs [X]

**Parallel Execution Example**:
```
T014 & T015 & T016
```

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete and independently testable.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- T017: Write feature documentation MD files in docs/ [X]
- T018: Review and lint code for style consistency [X]
- T019: Performance test for large images [X]

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) must complete before any user story
- Foundational (T004-T007) must complete before user stories
- User stories are independent but US1 should be completed first as MVP
- Polish (T017-T019) after all user stories

## Implementation Strategy
- MVP: Complete User Story 1 first
- Incremental delivery: Complete one user story phase before starting the next
- Parallel opportunities: Tasks in different files can run in parallel within phases
