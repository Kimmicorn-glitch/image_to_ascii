# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The feature adds file-based input and output for image to ASCII conversion, with dynamic symbol selection using advanced mathematical methods like statistical moments to determine the best fit symbol for each image block.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.8+ (to ensure compatibility with PIL and NumPy)  
**Primary Dependencies**: PIL (Pillow for image processing), NumPy (for array operations)  
**Storage**: N/A (file-based input/output)  
**Testing**: pytest (for unit and integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: Linux (cross-platform Python script)  
**Project Type**: single (CLI application)  
**Performance Goals**: Convert images to ASCII in under 10 seconds for 1000x1000 pixel images  
**Constraints**: Use only basic libraries (PIL, NumPy, standard library), keep memory usage under 100MB, no external APIs  
**Scale/Scope**: Small project, single script with modular functions, support for common image formats

 ## Constitution Check

 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

 - **Simplicity**: Ensure the proposed feature avoids unnecessary complexity and can be implemented simply.
 - **Separation of Concerns**: Verify that the feature can be modularized into its own module without tight coupling.
 - **Documentation**: Confirm that a Markdown file for the feature's documentation is planned.
 - **Basic Libraries**: Check that only NumPy and PIL are used, with no additional libraries unless justified.
  - **First Principles**: Assess if the feature can be implemented using fundamental mathematical concepts where applicable.

**Evaluation**: The feature passes all constitution checks. It maintains simplicity by using basic libraries, follows separation of concerns with modular design, includes MD documentation, uses only PIL and NumPy, and employs first principles math for symbol selection.

**Structure Decision**: Selected the single project structure with a package in src/ for modularity, tests/ for pytest, and docs/ for per-feature MD files.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
