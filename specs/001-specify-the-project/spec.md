 # Feature Specification: Image to ASCII Art Converter

 **Feature Branch**: `001-specify-the-project`  
 **Created**: 2025-10-09  
 **Status**: Draft  
  **Input**: User description: "i want to add an additional feature where i want it to read an image from a specific file and place the ascii art in a text file saved in another file. i also want to use relatively advanced math to convert the image/ choose what symbol"

 ## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

 ### User Story 1 - Basic Image Conversion (Priority: P1)

 A user wants to convert a standard image into ASCII art to view or share a text-based representation.

 **Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers the primary value of the application, enabling basic image-to-text conversion.

 **Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a sample image and verifying that ASCII art is generated and displayed, delivering a recognizable text representation of the image.

 **Acceptance Scenarios**:

 1. **Given** the user has selected an image file, **When** they initiate the conversion, **Then** the system generates and displays ASCII art based on the image.
 2. **Given** the conversion is complete, **When** the user views the output, **Then** the ASCII art resembles the original image's shapes and contrasts.

 ---

 ### User Story 2 - Customizable Output Dimensions (Priority: P2)

 A user wants to adjust the size of the ASCII art to fit specific display needs, such as a terminal window or document.

 **Why this priority**: Allows users to tailor the output for different contexts, enhancing usability without affecting the core conversion.

 **Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting custom width and height parameters and confirming the ASCII art matches the specified dimensions while maintaining image fidelity.

 **Acceptance Scenarios**:

 1. **Given** the user sets a desired width and height for the ASCII art, **When** they convert the image, **Then** the output respects those dimensions.
 2. **Given** the output dimensions are constrained, **When** the conversion occurs, **Then** the system scales the image appropriately without distortion.

 ---

 ### User Story 3 - Save and Share Output (Priority: P3)

 A user wants to save the generated ASCII art to a file or share it directly.

 **Why this priority**: Enables users to preserve and distribute the results, adding practical value for reuse.

 **Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating ASCII art, saving it to a file, and verifying the file contains the correct text representation.

 **Acceptance Scenarios**:

 1. **Given** ASCII art has been generated, **When** the user chooses to save it, **Then** the system exports it to a text file.
 2. **Given** the saved file, **When** the user opens it, **Then** the ASCII art is intact and readable.

 ### Edge Cases

 - What happens when the image file is corrupted or in an unsupported format?
 - How does the system handle very large images that might cause performance issues?
 - What if the specified output dimensions are too small to represent the image meaningfully?
  - How does the system respond if no suitable ASCII symbols can be selected for certain image areas?
  - Invalid image format
  - Image too large
  - File not found
  - Conversion failure

 ## Requirements *(mandatory)*

 ### Functional Requirements

 - **FR-001**: System MUST accept image input in common formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and produce ASCII art output.
 - **FR-002**: System MUST select ASCII symbols based on image density and how well they fit within the allocated space for each section.
 - **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify output dimensions (width and height) for the ASCII art.
 - **FR-004**: System MUST generate ASCII art that visually represents the original image's key features and contrasts.
 - **FR-005**: System MUST provide an option to save the ASCII art to a text file.
 - **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors gracefully, such as invalid image formats, with user-friendly messages.

 ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

 - **Image**: Represents the input file, including attributes like format, dimensions, and pixel data.
 - **ASCII Art**: Represents the output text, including selected symbols, dimensions, and layout.

 ## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

 ### Measurable Outcomes

 - **SC-001**: Users can convert a standard image to ASCII art in under 10 seconds.
 - **SC-002**: The generated ASCII art accurately represents at least 80% of the original image's key shapes and contrasts as judged by visual inspection.
 - **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete the conversion process on their first attempt without errors.
  - **SC-004**: Users can generate ASCII art for images up to 1000x1000 pixels without performance degradation.

## Assumptions

- Image size: No strict limit, but performance may degrade for very large images.

## Constraints and Tradeoffs

- Prioritize accuracy over speed

## Algorithm for Symbol Selection

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for shape matching.

- Machine learning classification for symbol prediction.
